# Level 3 Task 3 – Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

This task implements a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Java with full functionality:

## Features

- Insert nodes into the BST  
- Delete nodes from the BST  
- Search for values  
- In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order traversals  

## How It Works

1. User selects an option from the console menu  
2. BST operations are performed based on user input  
3. Program handles edge cases like deleting non-existent nodes  
4. Traversals display the tree structure in order  

## Skills Used

- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Recursion  
- Trees and Binary Search Tree concepts  
- Console input/output  
- Problem-solving and algorithm design  

This task completes **Level 3 Tasks** of the Codveda Internship, demonstrating advanced Java programming skills.
