# Level 2 Task 1 – Employee Management System

This Java console application implements a simple Employee Management System with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.  
It demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming concepts and collection handling.

## Features

- Add new employee with ID, name, and salary  
- View all employees  
- Update employee details  
- Delete employee by ID  
- Input validation for operations  

## How It Works

1. User selects an option from the menu.  
2. Program performs the corresponding operation on an in-memory list of employees.  
3. The loop continues until the user chooses to exit.  

## Skills Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects)  
- ArrayList for storing employee records  
- Methods for modular code  
- Conditionals and loops  
- User input via Scanner  

This task is part of **Level 2 Tasks** in the Codveda Internship and helps practice CRUD operations and core Java concepts.
