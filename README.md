# Codveda Internship Tasks – Java Development

This repository contains all tasks completed during my **Java Development Internship** at **Codveda Technologies**.  
The tasks are organized into three levels: **Level 1 (Basic), Level 2 (Intermediate), and Level 3 (Advanced)**.  
Each task demonstrates hands-on coding skills, problem solving, and Java programming concepts.

## Level 1 – Basic Tasks

Focus: Core Java fundamentals, console applications, recursion, random number generation.  

| Task | Description | Folder |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Basic Calculator | Console-based calculator supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Handles invalid inputs and division by zero. | [`level1_Tasks/level1-calculator`](level1_Tasks/level1-calculator) |
| Number Guessing Game | Interactive game where the user guesses a randomly generated number. Provides feedback and limits attempts. | [`level1_Tasks/level1-number-guess`](level1_Tasks/level1-number-guess) |
| Factorial Using Recursion | Recursive implementation to compute factorial of a number. Handles edge cases like zero and negative numbers. | [`level1_Tasks/level1-factorial`](level1_Tasks/level1-factorial) |

## Level 2 – Intermediate Tasks

Focus: Object-Oriented Programming, file handling, collections, and basic CRUD operations.  

| Task | Description | Folder |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Banking Application | Simple console-based banking system to deposit, withdraw, and check balances. Handles basic errors like insufficient funds. | [`level2_Tasks/level2-banking`](level2_Tasks/level2-banking) |
| File Handling | Read data from a file, process it (e.g., word/line count), and write output to a new file. Handles file exceptions. | [`level2_Tasks/level2-file-handling`](level2_Tasks/level2-file-handling) |
| Employee Management System | Manage employee records using OOP principles with CRUD functionality. Stores data in-memory using ArrayList. | [`level2_Tasks/level2-employee-management`](level2_Tasks/level2-employee-management) |
