# Level 1 Task 3 – Factorial Using Recursion

This task focuses on implementing a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.  
It demonstrates how recursion works and how to handle special inputs.

## Features

• Recursive factorial computation  
• Handles factorial of zero  
• Handles negative numbers with a clear message  
• Clean and simple logic

## How It Works

The user enters a number.  
The program calls a recursive method that calculates factorial by repeating the function call until the base case is reached.

If the user enters a negative number, the program displays an appropriate message.

## Skills Used

• Recursion  
• Conditionals  
• Console input (Scanner)  
• Basic mathematical logic
