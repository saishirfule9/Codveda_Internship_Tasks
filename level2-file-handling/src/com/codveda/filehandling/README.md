## How It Works

1. User provides the input file name and output file name.  
2. Program reads the input file line by line.  
3. Counts the number of lines and words.  
4. Writes the results to the output file.  
5. Displays processing summary on the console.

## Skills Used

- Java File I/O (BufferedReader, BufferedWriter)  
- Exception handling (try-catch)  
- Loops and string processing  
- User input via Scanner  

This is part of **Level 2 Tasks** in the Codveda Internship and showcases file processing and exception management in Java.
