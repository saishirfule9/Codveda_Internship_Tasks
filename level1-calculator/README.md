# Level 1 Tasks – Codveda Internship

This folder contains all Level 1 tasks completed as part of my Java Development Internship at Codveda Technologies.  
Each task is built using core Java concepts and focuses on logic building, user interaction, and clean coding practices.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Basic Calculator  
A simple console based calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
Handles invalid operations and division by zero gracefully.

### 2. Number Guessing Game  
A small game where the program generates a random number and the user tries to guess it.  
Includes input validation, attempt limit, and feedback messages to guide the user.

### 3. Factorial Using Recursion  
A recursive implementation to compute the factorial of a number.  
Handles edge cases such as factorial of zero and negative inputs.

Each task is placed in its own folder with source code and documentation.  
This helps maintain a clean structure and makes the project easy to navigate.
