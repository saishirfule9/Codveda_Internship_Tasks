# Level 1 Task 2 – Number Guessing Game

This program is a small interactive game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.  
It is designed to practice loops, conditionals, and user interaction in Java.

## Features

• Random number generation  
• User input validation  
• Feedback messages like "too high" or "too low"  
• Limited number of attempts  
• Graceful handling of non numeric input

## How It Works

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
The user gets a fixed number of attempts to guess it.  
After each guess, the program tells whether the guess was high or low.  
At the end, it either congratulates the user or reveals the correct number.

## Skills Used

• Java Random class  
• Loops  
• Conditionals  
• Try catch blocks for invalid input  
• Console user interaction
